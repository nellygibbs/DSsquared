# DS^2 

## Introduction
DS Squared is a full CRUD web application made using the Django framework, Python language, PostreSQL database and Lyric Genius API. It allows the user to easily search for a robust influx of information pertaining to their favorite lyrics, songs and artists. The user has the ability to search via a blurb of lyrics they overheard at the bar, or their favorite childhood song they can't remember the lyrics to, plus get important information on their new favorite artist. They can also sign up to with a free account that will give them access to rate each of these categories. Their ratings will be saved for future use. Our idea was to give the user a resource to search for all things lyrics related that is easy to use!
